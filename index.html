            <p>As a church we host Tuesday prayer meetings where families and individuals come together to seek God in worship and prayer. These gatherings provide a peaceful time to reflect, share burdens, and strengthen faith as a community.
                 Just as the youth programs help children grow in their relationship with God, the prayer & fasting meetings create a supportive space for everyone to be encouraged, uplifted, and spiritually refreshed.</p>

            <p>Every Friday after school, our church hosts a Youth & Kids Club where children gather in a safe and welcoming environment to learn about God, enjoy fun activities, and create crafts together. Through Bible stories and interactive lessons, they grow in their understanding of faith while also building friendships and developing important 
                life values such as kindness, respect, and teamwork. The crafts and activities not only make learning exciting but also encourage creativity and confidence. 
                This program is a wonderful way for children to be positively engaged after school, helping them grow spiritually, socially, and personally.</p>

 <h1 class="headings" id="us"><u>ABOUT</u></h1>
 <br>
 <p class="para">ACTS OF THE APOSTLES is a vibrant and growing church founded in 2021, located in Barcelona, Etwatwa Ext 32, within the City of Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality. From the very beginning, our church was established with a clear and passionate mission: to spread the Gospel and build a united, multicultural community rooted in faith, love, and service.

Our foundation scripture is Gospel of Mark 16:15 — “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation.” This verse defines who we are. It inspires us to reach beyond walls, beyond backgrounds, and beyond limitations to share the message of hope and salvation with everyone.

As a multicultural church, we celebrate diversity and believe that every culture, language, and background reflects the beauty of God’s creation. We are committed to creating a welcoming and inclusive environment where individuals and families can grow spiritually, build meaningful relationships, and discover their God-given purpose.
We believe the church is not just a building, but a living body of believers united in Christ. Whether you are new to faith, seeking a spiritual home, or looking to deepen your relationship with God, Acts of the Apostles is a place where you can belong, grow, and be sent out to make a difference.

Our doors are open, our hearts are ready, and our mission continues — to go, to preach, and to transform lives through the power of the Gospel.</p>
